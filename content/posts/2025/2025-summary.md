Another revolution around the Sun awakens in people a strange desire to write the summary of their year in the form of a blog post, and I’ve succumbed to that primal instinct as well.

2025 was a year of learning and reassessment for me. I learned quite a few new things, and changed my view on some of what I’d already known. There were no major achievements this year, but I feel like I’m a tiny bit better programmer now than a year ago. As cheesy as it may sound, my passion for programming is just as strong as it’s ever been, and it’s one of the things that makes me want to wake up sooner when I go to bed.

1.	**<a href="https://github.com/savvy-itch/blog-site" target="_blank">Built a blog using Django</a>** (not this one). For my final project for CS50 Web course I built a blog using Django, and I quite enjoyed my experience with it. Its batteries-included approach (especially the admin page) and templates made for a smooth DX and short “idea->result” path. I don’t think I’ll be using Python much, though, as JavaScript already covers all my web needs. Still, I keep it in mind as a viable option for quick website building, and it gave me an opportunity to try out a different approach to web dev.
2.	**Began learning C**. Even though my passion for programming hasn’t diminished, my fondness for web dev in particular has withered a bit. Having dipped my toes in both front- and back-end, I eventually grew tired of catching up with ever-changing frameworks and being dependent on the browser/runtime as my only coding playground. And so I started learning C with no particular goal in mind, if only to try something completely different. And I liked it. C has such a good balance of high-level clarity with low-level control, and the feeling of interacting directly with your machine is special. I’ve been learning it from K. N. King’s “C Programming – A Modern Approach”. It’s a great, thorough read, and I expect to finish it soon.
3.	**<a href="https://github.com/savvy-itch/vocab-it-desktop" target="_blank">Built my first desktop app</a>** – a version of Vocab-It, my language learning web app. Combining my aforementioned desire to break out of the conventional web routine with a necessity of having the desktop app for myself, I tried for the first time desktop app development with Electron. Given my original web version was written in React, transitioning it to Electron was easy. As with Django, I didn’t have a particular need or desire to dedicate more time to Electron, but it was definitely worth it. In the end, if I don’t feel like sticking with the technology/domain, it’s still a new experience and one less path for me in the overwhelming range of programming activities.
4. **<a href="https://github.com/savvy-itch/another-tasks-app" target="_blank">Built my first Android app</a>**.  Continuing my exploration of different programming areas within the range of my capabilities, I decided to build a tasks app for Android. It was intended for my mom, who has a habit of writing down her daily tasks and then forget some of them. I went with React Native/Expo, and, even though I finished it eventually, this was one of the most frustrating dev experiences I’ve ever had. Nothing about it felt native. Suffice it to say, I won’t be pursuing mobile app development any time soon. My mom wasn’t fond of the app either.
5.	Last year I built a <a href="https://github.com/savvy-itch/site-block-extension" target="_blank">browser extension for blocking distracting websites</a>. Throughout this year, I continued maintaining it, having released a couple of minor releases that added some features and fixed some bugs. It’s not much, but it’s always good to have an ongoing pet project that’s not just a one-off. I have a few ideas on how to make it better that I’m going to work on next year.
6.	Lastly, I **created this blog**. I was looking for something that would be just as convenient as Django, but also minimalist in structure, easy to host, and with as little time spent on configuration as possible. That’s how I settled on 11ty. Its templates-based architecture was just what I was looking for. The plugins were also easy to use. It has its limitations and drawbacks (e.g. inability to minify passthrough files), but for now this option satisfies my needs.

As for non programming related deeds, I started to work out more, and wrote 2 music tracks. That’s about it.

I deliberately stopped making long-term plans a while ago because of the frustrating unpredictability of life events, therefore I don’t have any set goals for the next year. I do have a vague direction in which I want to go with programming. Hopefully, next year will be more productive, peaceful and stable than this one.
